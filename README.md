📝 Overview
The BlitzBoom Game Editor V2.0 is a robust, feature-rich tool designed to empower level designers and content creators to build, test, and package custom game content for BlitzBoom.

This major revision focuses on an intuitive workflow, improved stability, and real-time visualization, allowing creators to rapidly prototype and iterate on maps, mechanics, and asset placements without writing a single line of code.

✨ Key Features
We built V2.0 with efficiency and power in mind. Here are the core features that define this editor:

👁️ Real-Time 3D Viewport: Instant feedback on asset placement, lighting, and level geometry.

📦 Integrated Asset Management: Easily import, organize, and categorize game assets (models, textures, sounds) directly within the editor.

🔗 Custom Scripting Hooks: Expose crucial game logic variables and functions for advanced level mechanics via an integrated scripting console.

💥 Physics & Collision Debugging: Visualize hitboxes, collision meshes, and physics interactions in-editor before deployment.

🌎 Multi-Platform Export: Generate ready-to-use content packages compatible with all BlitzBoom supported platforms.

🛡️ Non-Destructive Editing: Work safely with version control integration and an extensive history stack.
